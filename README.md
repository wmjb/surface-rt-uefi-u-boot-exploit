this branch reliably loads u-boot on primary core, does not bring up secondary cores.

Launching U-Boot from uefi on EDK2 nvidia hardware, tegra 30. surface by writing to secondary core smc handler address 82002880 pointing it to a payload loaded into memory at 83100000. then the payload launcher using acpi protocol unparks secondary core and this core issues smc call due to payload_secondary being loaded and its address set into secondary core 1 parking mailbox address. the payload loader issues a interrupt to unpark the secondary core which causes payload in memory to execute. payload running on secondary core copies another payload to primary core smc call handler address 80112174. once this is complete secondary payload signals to payload launcher to issue smc call which then the primary core payload is executed and u boot placed into memory by payload launcher at 84000000 is loaded and running and ready to boot into an os.

however at this stage secondary cores are unavailable to the os.


Payload launcher to be used as bootarm.efi - included

payload.bin to be used as primary core payload - included 

payload2.bin to be used as secondary core payload. - included

payload_secondary.bin used to launch payload2 on secondary cores by unparking - included

u-boot.dtb.bin used as bootloader and launched at 84000000 - https://github.com/wmjb/surface-rt-uefi-u-boot

place all 5 files on root of usb and boot.
